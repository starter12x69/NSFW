🛠️ Replit Prompt:

I already have a working website for my NSFW AI image generator. Right now it includes a headline, a short description, a prompt input, and a “Generate” button — but the generation is not yet live.

Please rebuild the website to reflect a pre-launch landing page with the goal of collecting early access signups and building trust.

Here’s what I need:

⸻

✅ 1. Hero Section (Top of Page)
	•	Headline: “NSFW AI Image Generator. Hyper-Realistic. Ultra-Customizable.”
	•	Subheadline: “Generate private, powerful adult content with full control over styles and details. Launching soon — early access available.”
	•	Replace the “Generate” button with a new button labeled: “Get Early Access”
	•	When clicked, this button opens a modal with this message:
“We’re finalizing the backend. Be the first to try it and unlock special launch credits.”
Include an email input field and a “Notify Me” button.

⸻

✅ 2. Image Gallery Section
	•	Create a responsive grid layout that displays sample images (placeholders for now).
	•	Above each image, include a sample tag like: Cyberpunk Girl, Blowjob, Goth GF, Realistic, etc.
	•	Add a short text above the gallery: “See what’s possible”

⸻

✅ 3. FAQ Section
	•	Add an FAQ section at the bottom with these questions and answers:
	•	Is this anonymous? Yes. We don’t log prompts or store your generations.
	•	When will it launch? We’re currently testing and improving — join early access for updates.
	•	Will my images be private? Yes. Everything is generated on isolated infrastructure.
	•	Can I generate hardcore content? Yes — this tool is built for full freedom.
	•	Will I need to pay? Yes, but early users get bonus credits at launch.

⸻

✅ Other notes:
	•	Make sure the existing prompt input, generation logic, or buttons are hidden or removed for now — users shouldn’t be able to generate images yet.
	•	Keep the styling clean and responsive — use modern fonts and layout.
	•	Focus everything around building anticipation and capturing emails.

Thank you!
